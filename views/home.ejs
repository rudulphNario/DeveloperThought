                <p>When developers make things that help improve life quickly or solve the problem to make things done.
                    As a result, we can save energy and money. Imagine you walk to the supermarket to go shopping, take
                    a lot of stuff from your shopping list, and suddenly when you're standing at the counter to pay the
                    bill. And you notice your wallet wasn't in your purse. Then the Developer came to the rescue. They
                    build mobile apps, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Paypal, etc., providing contactless payments. Now you can
                    shop easily using your mobile apps but make sure there's enough money in them.</p>
