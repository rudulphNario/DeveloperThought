            Technology has changed a lot. We didnâ€™t know if these changes could help in our everyday lives. 
            This site contains the old and latest technology and how they build and how to become functional.

            lifesavers in their day-to-day lives, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Web development,
            Machine Learning, Data Science, and many other things.
